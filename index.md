# Devarsh Omni-Wheel project
This is the Mecham Omni-Wheel robot built and completed by Devarsh Ganoorkar. I chose this project because I wanted to explore mobility, structures and electrical engineering concepts while also integrating my software experience. The biggest challenge I experienced was the quality and avaliablity of materials, I had to work with many faulty parts such as the broken LED lights, missing screws and malfunctioning IR sensors - however this was also my biggest triumph as I was able to complete the project regardless and found innovative substitues/aternatives for the missing and/or faulty parts. I was very fascinated by the electrical engineering aspect of this project as I found the arduino code to be a little bit difficult to understand without a solid background in electrical concepts. After learning about wiring and the different functions of parts such as the wifi shield, megaboard and motors - I was able to effectively visualise and understand how the arduino software integrated within the entire system. I also learned about H-diagrams, digital and analog signals/inputs and how HIGH and LOW functions can be used to bring upon rotation and varied movements through the motors.

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

In my second milestone - I completed the steps I planned in my Milestone 1 video by inputting the code and setting up the ultrasonic sensors and infrared sensors. I also learned a lot about the different functions and inner workings of both the Ultrasonic sensor and IR sensors and how they take in inputs from different frequencies/wavelenghts to perform tasks such as object detection and line tracking. I did face several challenges with some more faulty components such as one of the IR sensors simply failed to respond while I had another set of screws missing to attach the ultrasonic sensor which may have interfered with the stability and accuracy of its object detection capabilities. I again overcame these challenges by using whatever materials I had around me (tape, different screws, etc) to attach the US sensor in a somewhat stable fashion which allowed the robot to work effectively. Before my final milestone - all I really need to accomplish is to gather the correct materials from my instructors and correct the faulty parts (IR sensors and wheels). Lastly, I would also prefer to finish up my modifications which I plan to be either another component of the Osyoo kit and code provided to me or my unique touch to the project (a thermal sensor with object identifcation capabilities). If possible - I would love to do both but that would have to work with my time constraints and learning curve needed to work on complex mods like the thermal sensor/imaging.

My first milestone was essentially gaining basic functionality and proper movement with the robot. I wanted to have it completely assembled and ready to move freely, however, with the missing parts, this proved to be somewhat of a challenge as the wheels were unable to fit through. I used tape, hammering and even glue to provide a temporary fix to this problem but after several launches, the wheels would evenutally fall off. This issue was major but I still persisted - I used the started code to program my robot to perform some basic rotational and forward-backward movements while also learning a lot about wiring and the functions of the different components. My plan to complete my project is to first have the main assembly finished and then I would like to start working with some of the really cool components given to me such as the Ultrasonic and IR sensors to complete complex tasks such as object detection and line tracking, which I think are very excellent projects/activities to further my understanding of electrical engineering. 

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```
